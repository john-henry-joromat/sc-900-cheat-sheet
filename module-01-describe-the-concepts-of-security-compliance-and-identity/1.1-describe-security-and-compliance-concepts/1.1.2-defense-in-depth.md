# 1.1.2: Defense in Depth

---
 ## 🛡 What Is Defense in Depth? ##
It’s a **layered security strategy**, not a one-wall-fits-all model. Each security layer acts like a tripwire — if one fails, the next still stands. The idea is to **slow down or block attackers** at every step of the way.
Think “castle defense”: moat, wall, guards, gates, inner wall, secret passage booby-trapped with bees — the works.

## 🔁 Security Layers in Defense in Depth ##
Here’s how it stacks up, from physical to digital:
1.	## 🧍‍♂️ Physical Security ##
    - Controlled access to buildings and datacenters (badge readers, security guards).
2.	## 🧑‍💼 Identity and Access Security ##
    - Things like **multifactor authentication (MFA)** and **conditional access policies**.
3.	## 🌐 Perimeter Security ##
    - Network edge protections like **firewalls** and **DDoS protection** to block external threats.
4.	## 🛠 Network Securityy ##
    - Internal safeguards like **network segmentation** and **access control lists (ACLs)**.
5.	## 💻 Compute Layer Security ##
    - Locking down **virtual machines** or **servers** by closing unused ports and enforcing secure access.
6.	## 📦 Application Security ##
    - Ensuring apps are **patched**, **hardened**, and **free of known vulnerabilities**.
7.	## 🗃 Data Layer Security ##
    - o	Access controls and encryption to protect the actual crown jewels — your data. If an attacker breaks through one, the next layer buys you time or stops them outright.

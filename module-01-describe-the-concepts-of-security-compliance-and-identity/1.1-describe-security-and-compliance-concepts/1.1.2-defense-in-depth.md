# 1.1.2: Defense in Depth

---
 ## 🛡 What Is Defense in Depth? ##
It’s a **layered security strategy**, not a one-wall-fits-all model. Each security layer acts like a tripwire — if one fails, the next still stands. The idea is to **slow down or block attackers** at every step of the way.
Think “castle defense”: moat, wall, guards, gates, inner wall, secret passage booby-trapped with bees — the works.

## 🔁 Security Layers in Defense in Depth ##
Here’s how it stacks up, from physical to digital:
1.	**🧍‍♂️ Physical Security**
    - Controlled access to buildings and datacenters (badge readers, security guards).
2.	**🧑‍💼 Identity and Access Security**
    - Things like **multifactor authentication (MFA)** and **conditional access policies**.
3.	**🌐 Perimeter Security**
    - Network edge protections like **firewalls** and **DDoS protection** to block external threats.
4.	**🛠 Network Securityy**
    - Internal safeguards like **network segmentation** and **access control lists (ACLs)**.
5.	**💻 Compute Layer Security**
    - Locking down **virtual machines** or **servers** by closing unused ports and enforcing secure access.
6.	**📦 Application Security**
    - Ensuring apps are **patched**, **hardened**, and **free of known vulnerabilities**.
7.	**🗃 Data Layer Security**
    - **Access controls** and **encryption** to protect the actual crown jewels — your data.
    
If an attacker breaks through one, the next layer buys you time or stops them outright.

## 🔺 The CIA Triad: Cybersecurity’s Holy Trinity ##

Every layer above is designed to uphold these three principles:
**1. Confidentiality**
- Keep private stuff private (data, passwords, keys).
- Use encryption — and guard the **keys like your life depends on it** (because in a breach, it might).
**2. Integrity**
- Data shouldn’t change without permission.
- You want your messages, files, and transactions to arrive unchanged, not "hacked halfway."
**3. Availability**
- Data must be **usable and accessible** to those who need it.
- Encryption is great, but if nobody can access it when needed, you’ve just built Fort Knox around a filing cabinet no one can open.

**📌 Summary of Key Takeaways**
- **Defense in depth = multiple overlapping security layers.**
- The model assumes **one layer may fail**, so others should compensate.
- **CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)** is the core objective of all layers.
- Microsoft and others offer tools to support this strategy across all layers.
- Cybercriminals aim to compromise CIA — your job is to maintain it at every level.

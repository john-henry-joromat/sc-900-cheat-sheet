# 1.1.3: Zero Trust Model

---
 ## 🧠 What Is the Zero Trust Model? ##
**"Trust no one, verify everything."**
That’s the Zero Trust motto. It assumes **nothing inside or outside your network is inherently secure**, not even devices behind your corporate firewall.
Why? Because attackers are too sneaky. Traditional security (like assuming everything behind the firewall is safe) doesn’t cut it anymore.

---
## 🧱 Core Concept ##
Zero Trust flips the old-school model on its head:
- **No implicit trust** — even internal traffic is treated with suspicion.
- **Strong, continuous verification** — identity, device, location, and behavior are all checked.
- **Restricted access** — users only get what they need, nothing more.

## 🧭 The 3 Guiding Principles ##
**1. ✅ Verify Explicitly**
- Authenticate and authorize using real-time context:
    - Identity
    - Device health
    - Location
    - Data sensitivity
    - Behavioral anomalies
**2. 🔐 Least Privilege Access**
- Give users only the access they need, and only when they need it.
- Use:
    - **JIT (Just-in-Time)** access
    - **JEA (Just-Enough Access)**
    - Risk-based access policies
**3. 🚨 Assume Breach**
- **Design like you’ve already been compromised.**
- Segment networks, encrypt everything, monitor constantly, and expect the worst so you’re prepared.

## 🏗 The 6 Pillars of Zero Trust ##
These are the six domains where Zero Trust is applied:
| **Pillar** | **Description** |
| **1. Identity** | Users, services, and devices must authenticate and follow least privilege. |
| **2. Devices** | All endpoints must be monitored for health, compliance, and risk. |
| **3. Applications** | Shadow IT included. Manage all apps and their access permissions. |
| **4. Data** | Protect the data itself: classify, label, and encrypt it. |
| **5. Infrastructure** | Monitor both cloud and on-prem resources. Use telemetry and JIT access. |
| **6. Network** | Use segmentation (including micro segmentation), encryption, and analytics. |

**🧩 Summary of Key Takeaways**
- **Zero Trust = Continuous verification + minimal access + assume breach.**
- Everything is suspect, even internal devices and users.
- **3 rules:** Always verify, limit access, expect a breach.
- **6 layers** work together: Identity, Devices, Apps, Data, Infrastructure, Network.
- Real-world implementation means:
    - MFA is standard
    - Network segmentation is deep
    - Shadow IT is hunted down
    - Access is tightly controlled and temporary
    - Visibility and threat detection are baked in

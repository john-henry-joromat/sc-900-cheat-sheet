# 1.1.1: Shared Responsibility Model

---

##  🧱 The Basic Premise ## 
- When you're fully on-premises, you own everything—security, compliance, hardware, and headaches.
- In the cloud, you share the load. Some things are your job, and some are handled by the cloud provider.
- The exact split depends on the cloud service type: IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS.

## 💡 The Shared Responsibility Model by Deployment Type ## 

*** 🏢 On-Premises ***
- *** You do it all: *** Physical security, networking, OS, apps, data—you’re the boss and the janitor.

*** 🖥️ Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) ***
- *** Think: *** Azure VMs, AWS EC2.
- *** Cloud Provider: *** Handles hardware, datacenter, physical security, basic networking.
- *** You: *** Handle OS, applications, firewalls, data, identity, and access management.
- *** High customer responsibility ***— this is closest to on-prem in terms of hands-on management.

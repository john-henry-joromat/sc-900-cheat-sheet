# 1.1.1: Shared Responsibility Model

---

##  🧱 The Basic Premise ## 
- When you're fully on-premises, you own everything—security, compliance, hardware, and headaches.
- In the cloud, you share the load. Some things are your job, and some are handled by the cloud provider.
- The exact split depends on the cloud service type: IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS.

## 💡 The Shared Responsibility Model by Deployment Type ## 

**🏢 On-Premises**
- **You do it all:** Physical security, networking, OS, apps, data—you’re the boss and the janitor.

**🖥️ Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- **Think:** Azure VMs, AWS EC2.
- **Cloud Provider:** Handles hardware, datacenter, physical security, basic networking.
- **You:** Handle OS, applications, firewalls, data, identity, and access management.
- **High customer responsibility**— this is closest to on-prem in terms of hands-on management.

**🔧 Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

- **Think:** Azure App Service, Google App Engine.
- **Cloud Provider:** Manages servers, storage, networking, and OS.
- **You:** Focus on your apps and data.
- **Middle ground**—you build and deploy; they manage the boring backend stuff.

**☁️ Software as a Service (SaaS)**

-**Think:** Microsoft 365, Salesforce.
-**Cloud Provider:** Manages everything behind the scenes—apps, OS, infrastructure.
-**You:** Manage data, devices, user access, and identities.
-**Lowest customer responsibility**—but you’re still in charge of your data and users.
